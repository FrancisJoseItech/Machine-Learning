Machine Learning Project: Predicting Last Traded Price (LTP)
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the Last Traded Price (LTP) of financial instruments using various machine learning techniques. The project involves extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of advanced regression models to build a robust predictive model. The pipeline developed ensures consistency across datasets and prepares the data for accurate predictions.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing Pipeline: A comprehensive pipeline that standardizes column names, handles missing data, performs feature engineering, and transforms skewed data for better model performance.

Feature Engineering: Extraction of relevant features such as month and day_of_week from the date, along with cyclical transformations to capture temporal patterns effectively.

Model Selection and Tuning: Implementation of multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVR, and Neural Networks. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model performance.

Evaluation Metrics: Models are evaluated using key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² score to ensure accuracy and reliability.

Pipeline Integration: The project includes a flexible pipeline that can be applied to both training and new datasets, making it adaptable for various use cases.

Visualization: Visualizations are included to provide insights into model performance, including scatter plots of actual vs. predicted values, residual plots, and learning curves.

How to Use
Data Preparation: Start by preparing your dataset using the provided preprocessing pipeline. This includes standardizing column names, handling missing values, and transforming features.

Model Training: Use the training script to fit different models on the processed dataset. The script includes hyperparameter tuning to find the best model configuration.

Model Evaluation: After training, evaluate the model performance using the provided evaluation metrics and visualizations to ensure the model meets the desired accuracy.

Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Customization: The pipeline and model evaluation code are designed to be easily customizable for different datasets or financial instruments.
